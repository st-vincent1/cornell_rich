He stages elaborate fake suicides, attends funerals (usually for people that he doesn't know), and drives a hearse, all to the chagrin of his self-obsessed, wealthy socialite mother.[4] His mother sends Harold to a psychoanalyst, sets him up with blind dates, and buys him a luxury car, all schemes he subverts in his own way. Harold meets 79-year-old Maude one day while at a random stranger's funeral Mass, and discovers that they share a hobby. Harold is entranced by Maude's quirky outlook on life, which is bright and delightfully carefree in contrast with his moribund demeanor. Harold's mother is determined, against Harold's wishes, to find him a wife. One by one, Harold frightens and horrifies each of his appointed computer dates, by appearing to commit gruesome acts: self-immolation, self-mutilation, and seppuku. His mother tries enlisting him in the military by sending Harold to his uncle, who lost an arm serving under General MacArthur in the Second World War, but Harold deters the recruitment by staging a scene where Maude poses as a pacifist protester and Harold seemingly murders her out of militarist fanaticism. As Harold and Maude grow closer, their friendship blossoms into a romance. Holding her hand, Harold discovers a number tattooed on her forearm, indicating Maude survived the Nazi death camps. Harold announces that he will marry Maude, resulting in disgusted outbursts from his family, analyst, and priest.

Why, sometimes in life, it's the only weapon we have.",True,u7294,m492,A man,"Roger is a slender, white rabbit with large blue eyes, a pink nose, a tuft of red hair who wears red overalls, yellow gloves, and a blue bow tie with yellow polka dots. He is an amalgamation of various classic cartoon characters from the Golden Age of American Animation of the 1930s-1960s; taking Bugs Bunny's cartoon rabbit form, Droopy's tuft of red hair, Porky Pig's bowtie, Mickey Mouse's gloves, and Goofy's baggy pants. Roger is hyperactive, friendly, talkative, funny, a bit childlike, and not very bright at times. He loves to make others laugh and is good friends with the other Toons, especially Baby Herman (his Maroon Cartoons co-star) and Benny the Cab. He is also cowardly and greatly fears Judge Doom, the Dip, and the Toon Patrol as well as many other hazards. Despite his traditionally cartoonish behaviour, Roger is aware of what most people think of cartoons, facts he's voiced to Eddie Valiant, in that making people laugh and smile is often what makes toons' lives worthwhile, but also notes that there are times when making people laugh and smile is the only weapon toons have. He believes that if someone “doesn't have a good sense of humour they're better off dead” and get upset over having to sit through things such as newsreels that he perceives as boring. He truly loves his wife Jessica and always makes her laugh. To him as he tells Eddie and his boss R.K. Maroon, Jessica is ""the light of his life"", ""the apple of his eye"" and ""the cream in his coffee."" Roger does not take well to human alcoholic beverages. It is shown twice in the film that when he has consumed one, he changes colour rapidly, at least one of his eyes pops open, his bow tie spins, and he mumbles incoherently at a fast pace, before stretching up into the air and whistling like a steam whistle at a loud enough tone to shatter glass, all the while flailing about. In the film, he is re-envisioned as a character in 1940s animated cartoons and a resident of the fictional Los Angeles enclave Toontown. He is framed for the murder of Acme Corporation C.E.O. Marvin Acme and seeks out Eddie Valiant to help clear his name.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Rabbit

Their town is occupied by the Union Army. Jesse's childhood friend Zee has grown into an attractive woman and Farmers are being pressured into selling their farms to the rail road company. If they don't sell their land to Thaddeus Rains, and his secret-service organizer, Allan Pinkerton, the farmers are burned out of their homes, or killed.
Frank finds the railroad doesn't even need their land. The James and Younger brothers don't want to sell, and Cole Younger loses his temper when several railroad men approach him about selling, and kills two of them. The army decides to hang him, but his brothers Bob and Jim, along with Jesse, Frank, and Zee, decide to rescue him. During the rescue, Jesse is shot in the shoulder, and hides out at Zee's.
A few weeks later, when Jesse has recovered, the railroad sets fire to the James' home, killing Jesse's mother. The James and Younger brothers ride out for revenge against the railroad men but instead focus on the bank's payroll, reasoning that if they steal the money and attack supply trains, the army will notice. Dubbing themselves the James–Younger Gang, they set out robbing banks, with Pinkerton and Rains struggling to stop them. The James gang turns themselves into folk heroes in the process.The gang struggles over leadership, with Cole feeling that Jesse is getting an overblown ego from the publicity of the gang's activities. Jesse backs down, after an argument, and lets Cole plan and execute a robbery; Cole's chosen target proves to be a trap set by Pinkerton and Rains. Jim is shot and killed, and Jesse and his brother leave the gang, with Jesse later marrying Zee. When Jesse and Zee attempt to start a new life, Pinkerton finds and arrests Jesse. During the train ride to the jail, Jesse is chained in a rear car, but tricks a deputy into showing his gun, which he takes from him and uses to escape to the top of the train car.
Zee and the remainder of the Gang shoot a cannon at the train, stopping it and rescuing Jesse. Confronted with Rains and Pinkerton, Jesse shoots neither of them but rather Rains' prized watch. Pinkerton tells Jesse that he should go to Tennessee, as 'the railroad has no interest in Tennessee'.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_James

They also discover that Leviathan was scuttled.The following morning, Sixpack feels sick and Doc discovers lesions along his back. He dies a few hours later, but Doc and Beck keep it quiet to avoid a panic. Doc checks the crew to confirm no one else is sick, but does not have the chance to examine Bowman.

Beck and Doc request emergency evacuation, but Martin reports a severe storm on the surface that will delay evacuation for 12 hours. Doc finds that Bowman killed herself. Her body is taken to sickbay, where it merges with Sixpack's. When the crew discovers the mutating bodies, they decide to dump both of them in the ocean. As they are about to ""flush"" the cadavers, the body bag begins squirming. Believing someone inside may be alive, the crew opens it. The creature inside claws Cobb before they eject it.

The ship's remaining crew consists of its new commanding officer, Lieutenant Doolittle (helmsman, and originally second-in-command), Sergeant Pinback (bombardier), Corporal Boiler (navigator), and Talby (target specialist). As the tedium of their tasks over 20 years has driven them ""around the bend"", they have created distractions for themselves: Doolittle, formerly a surfer from Malibu, California, constructed a musical bottle organ. Enroute to their next target (the Veil Nebula) the dark star is hit by a bolt of electromagnetic energy during a storm, resulting in another onboard malfunction and one of the artificially intelligent thermostellar triggering devices (Bomb #20) receives an order to deploy but du to the damage to the ship the crew cannot activate the release mechanism and attempt to abort the drop. After two prior accidental deployments, Bomb #20 refuses to disarm or abort the countdown sequence. As Pinback and Boiler try to talk the bomb out of blowing up underneath the ship, Doolittle revives Commander Powell, who advises him to teach the bomb the rudiments of phenomenology. After donning a space suit and exiting the ship to approach the bomb directly, Doolittle engages in a philosophical conversation with Bomb #20 until it decides to abort its countdown and retreat to the bomb bay for further contemplation. When attempting to assist Doolittle in re-entering the ship, Pinback inadvertently jettisons Talby out of the airlock. As Doolittle tries to rescue the now-conscious Talby, Pinback addresses the bomb over the intercom in another attempt to disarm it. Doolittle has mistakenly taught the bomb Cartesian doubt and, as a result, Bomb #20 determines that it can only trust itself and not external input. Convinced that only it exists, and that its sole purpose in life is to explode, Bomb #20 detonates. The Dark Star is destroyed, and Pinback and Boiler are killed instantly. Commander Powell is flung into space encased in ice, and Talby and Doolittle are blown in opposite trajectories. Talby drifts into the Phoenix Asteroids (a cluster he has long had a fascination with), destined to circumnavigate the universe for eternity. As Doolittle loses contact with Talby, he sees that he is falling toward the unstable planet. Realizing he will burn up upon entering its atmosphere, he drifts into debris from the Dark Star, finds a surfboard-shaped hunk of debris, and ""surfs"" down into the atmosphere, dying as a falling star.",https://ultimatepopculture.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Star_(film)

To make ends meet and against his better judgment, he takes a job as a croupier at a local casino. The interview was set up by his father, a small-time hustler back home in South Africa. Jack finds himself drawn into the casino world, and the job gradually takes over his life. He goes drinking with Matt, a croupier who he knows is cheating the casino. He sleeps with a fellow croupier named Bella in violation of casino policy. His relationship with his girlfriend Marion begins to deteriorate when he lets her read part of his book about a cold, unfeeling croupier who enjoys seeing gamblers lose, a character transparently based on Jack himself. Bella confronts Jack at his apartment, accuses him of getting her fired, and tells Marion about the one-night stand. One gambler, Jani, tries to befriend Jack, another serious violation of casino rules. Jani shows him bruises saying she got them from gambling creditors and asks Jack to be the inside man for a planned robbery at the casino. All he must do is raise the alarm when a gambler cheats at his table. Jack eventually agrees and accepts a £10,000 advance with an additional £10,000 if all goes well. In doing so, Jack notices that Jani's injuries were faked.
Marion reconciles with Jack but discovers that he is involved in something criminal and tries to foil it. She deletes a phone message for Jack alerting him that the robbery is on for Christmas Eve, and instead alerts a former colleague on the police. On the night of the robbery, Jack gets beaten by the gambler as a distraction while others try to grab the money. They fail, and Jack and Marion have an argument, but she stays with him.
When a late-night knock at the door comes, Jack assumes it to be the casino robbers demanding the return of their advance money. Instead, it is a policeman, who informs him that Marion has been killed in an apparent hit-and-run. Jack finishes his book and gets it published anonymously. It is a big success, but he doesn't change anything about his life, continuing to work as a croupier and live in his basement flat, not even buying the new car he wanted.
Jack goes on with his life and gets another call, this one from Jani, who congratulates him on playing his part in the attempted robbery and implies that she benefited significantly. Then she puts his father on the phone, and he implies that he set up the croupier job for Jack in order to arrange for the attempted robbery, and he benefited as well. Stunned but amused, Jack hangs up. Just then, Bella appears from the bedroom and kisses him.

While on holiday in the French Alps Reggie, an expatriate American working as a simultaneous interpreter, tells friend Sylvie that she is divorcing her husband, Charles. She also meets Peter Joshua, a charming American. On her return to Paris, she finds her apartment stripped bare. A police inspector says Charles sold off their belongings, then was murdered while leaving Paris. Their money is also missing. Reggie is given her husband's small travel bag, containing a letter addressed to her, a ship ticket to Venezuela, four passports in multiple names and nationalities, and other miscellaneous personal items. At Charles' sparsely attended funeral, three men show up to view the body. One sticks a pin into the corpse to confirm Charles is dead. Reggie is summoned to meet CIA administrator Hamilton Bartholomew at the American Embassy. She learns that the three men are Herman Scobie, Leopold W. Gideon, and Tex Panthollow. During World War II, they, Charles, and Carson Dyle were assigned by the OSS to deliver $250,000 in gold to the French Resistance, but instead stole it. Carson was fatally wounded in a German ambush, and Charles double-crossed the others, taking all the gold. The three survivors are after the missing money, as is the U.S. government. Hamilton insists Reggie has it, even if she does not know what or where it is—and that she is in great danger.
Peter locates Reggie and helps her move into a hotel. The three criminals separately threaten her, each convinced she knows where the money is. As the hunt for the money continues, Herman and Leopold are murdered. When she confronts Peter for his lies about his identity, he claims he is Adam Canfield, a professional thief. Although frustrated by his dishonesty, Reggie still trusts him. Reggie and Adam go to an outdoor market where Charles' last known appointment was. Spotting Tex, Adam follows him. At the stamp-selling booths, Adam and Tex each realize that Charles bought some extremely valuable stamps and affixed them to the envelope found in his travel bag. Both men race back to Reggie's hotel room, only to discover the stamps missing from the envelope. Reggie, who gave the stamps to Sylvie's young son, Jean-Louis, suddenly realizes their significance. She and Sylvie locate Jean-Louis, but he has already traded the stamps to a dealer. They find the dealer, who says the rare stamps are worth $250,000 in total. He returns them to Reggie. Reggie returns to the hotel and finds Tex's body with the name ""Dyle"" scrawled next to it. Convinced Adam is the murderer, a frightened Reggie telephones Hamilton, who says to meet him at the Colonnade at the Palais-Royal. Adam sees her and gives chase. At the Colonnade, Reggie is caught out in the open between the two men. Adam claims Hamilton is really Carson Dyle: surviving the German ambush, he became obsessed with revenge and reclaiming the treasure. Reggie runs into an empty theater and hides in the prompt box. Carson is about to shoot her, but Adam activates a trapdoor under him, and Carson falls to his death.
The next day, Reggie and Adam go to the embassy to turn over the stamps, though Adam declines going in. Inside, Reggie discovers that Adam is really Brian Cruikshank, a U.S. Treasury agent responsible for recovering stolen government property. With his identity now revealed, he proposes marriage to Reggie.

Nick behaves rudely and offends Matsumoto, while Charlie attempts to be more polite. Nick also makes contact with an American nightclub hostess, Joyce, who explains that Nick and Charlie represent American inefficiency and stupidity to the Japanese. Through her, Nick discovers Sato is fighting a gang war with a notorious crime boss, Sugai, and traveled to New York to disrupt Sugai's counterfeiting scheme. Nick joins a police raid without permission and takes a few $100 bills from the crime scene. The next day, when Matsumoto explains they have dishonored themselves, him, and the police force by his theft, Nick calls him a snitch and demonstrates the money is counterfeit by burning one of the bills. At night, Nick and Charlie walk back to their hotel drunk and unescorted, despite warnings about their safety. Separated from Charlie, Nick watches in horror as Sato and several others briefly torture Charlie before Sato beheads him. Nick is distraught and comforted by Joyce. As Matsumoto and Nick trail one of Sato's operatives, Nick admits he stole money in New York. Nick confronts Sato, who escapes when swarming police arrest Nick for waving a gun in public. Though deported, Nick sneaks off the plane to pursue Sato on his own, as Matsumoto has been suspended and demoted. Nick pursues Sato after a gunfight, and the two fight briefly. Nick gains the advantage and, having Sato at his mercy, has the choice of whether or not to kill Sato for Charlie and all the humiliation he has suffered. Matsumoto and Nick walk a handcuffed Sato into police headquarters to the amazement of everyone and later receive commendations, which Nick accepts gratefully. Before boarding his flight home, Nick thanks Matsumoto for his assistance and friendship, and gives him a dress shirt in a gift box. Underneath it, Matsumoto finds the counterfeit printing plates.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Police_Department_corruption_and_misconduct

Amber Atkins is an optimistic teenager who signs up to compete in the pageant so she can follow in the footsteps of her idols, Diane Sawyer, and her mother, a former contestant. Her fellow contestant is Rebecca (""Becky"") Leeman, the daughter of the richest man in town and his wife, Gladys Leeman, who is the head of the pageant organizing committee and a former winner. Various business connections between the Leeman Furniture Store and the judges of the pageant cause many to speculate that the contest will be rigged or fixed. Amber lives with her mother in a trailer home in the tiny town of Mount Rose, Minnesota. Where the fridge is full of Coors and the ground strewn with cigarette butts. But although her mother may drink and smoke too much, Amber deeply loves and appreciates her, but Amber is desperate to find a way out of Mount Rose, lest she end up like her mother, who also grew up there. Amber also works two jobs to earn some money. She's a dishwasher at the school and a beautician at the funeral home. Her talent is in tap dancing. Amber's mother has had her in tap shoes since she could first walk, and she's a natural at it. With her talent and passion for tap dancing, Amber could finally fulfil of dream of escaping the tiny, boring town she was born in, but she must overcome the challenge of winning the American Teen Princess Pageant, her only ticket out of Mount Rose. The pageant provides personal growth, scholarship, travel, and the chance to meet a few celebrities. If she wins the pageant in her hometown, Amber hopes to make it all the way to Lincoln, Alabama to compete for the national title. But many odd events occur around town during the run-up to the pageant, including the death of a contestant, the athletic and competitive Tammy Curry, who is killed when her tractor explodes, and the death (ruled a hunting accident) of a boy who Becky liked, but who showed himself partial to Amber. Amber decides to pull out of the pageant after her mother is injured in an explosion at their home, but re-enters to compete to follow her dreams and make her mother proud. At the dress rehearsal, fellow contestant Jenelle Betz swaps numbers with Amber. When Jenelle walks on stage at the beginning of rehearsal, a stage light falls and hits her in the head, knocking her unconscious and rendering her deaf. At the pageant, Amber performs her tap-dance number to a standing ovation, while Rebecca sings a cringe-worthy rendition of ""Can't Take My Eyes Off You"" and dances with a life-size Jesus doll on a crucifix.

An impromptu hypnosis session was held in which they all developed dream powers. However, in the dream, Freddy caught Joey Crusel and kept him in a coma. Both Nancy and Neil were relieved of duty because of what happened. When Neil informed Nancy that a nun told him that they had to find Freddy's bones to lay him to rest, Nancy decided to ask her father Donald where the bones are. Donald, however, refused Nancy's claim that Freddy was still alive. Leaving Neil to obtain information from her father, Nancy returned to Westin Hills in an attempt to save Kristen. She attempted to speak to Kristen, who was in the quiet room, but the orderly Max wouldn't allow her. Exasperated, she requested a meeting with the other kids to say goodbye and Max allowed her 5 minutes. Nancy gathered the kids up in the group therapy room for a hypnosis session aimed at helping Kristen and destroying Freddy. In the dreamworld, Nancy managed to rescue Kristen and Joey but was killed when Freddy disguised himself as her father and claimed he was sorry for all he put her through.

madmartigan,willow,81,Adult,Swordsman,Unknown,Galladoon, ,I am the greatest swordsman that ever lived.,True,u8931,m608,A man,"Madmartigan is the deuteragonist of Willow. He was a male Daikini from Galladoorn. A disgraced knight, led to the crow's cage at the Daikini Crossroads where he was left to die of thirst. He was freed by Willow Ufgood, who was seeking someone to watch over Daikini baby Elora Danan. Madmartigan took the infant to one of his many women acquaintances, but the baby was kidnapped by thieving Brownies before Madmartigan got too far.
Willow retrieved Elora, and found Madmartigan at a roadside tavern, while dressing up as ""Hilda"" to hide the fact that he and a wench were cheating on her brutish husband, Llug. As Llug discovered his wife's indiscretion, Nockmaar soldiers appeared seeking Elora. Both Madmartigan and Willow narrowly escaped with Elora as Madmartigan took out the soldiers.
Seeing that both he and Willow had the same route, he saw him safely to the fishing village near the island where Fin Raziel was captive, but shortly after Nockmaar soldiers caught up to him. Although he did not give the location away, they rode to the fishing village where Willow and Raziel were taken prisoners by Sorsha and all were led to General Kael's camp. Rool and Franjean who followed Willow, freed them from the camp, but in the process, Madmartigan became smitten with a fairy spell, the Dust of Broken Heart that drew him to sleeping Sorsha. The confusion allowed him and Willow time to escape on a sleighing shield.
They ended up in a snow village to which Madmartigan arrived in the form of a rolling snowball. However the Nockmaar soldiers were after them. They hid in a basement where Airk and other soldiers were also hidden. As Sorsha searched the hut, Madmartigan took her captive at the knife's point. Airk denied to help them to Tir Asleen but as they left on horse, Airk and the Galladoorn knights stopped Bavmorda's soldiers to go after them.
The team fled to Tir Asleen but Sorsha questioned whether Madmartigan meant the words of love, and while riding in the canyon maze, she escaped them. Madmartigan and Willow arrived to Tir Asleen expecting an army to defeat Bavmorda. All they found instead was a cursed castle infested with trolls.
Madmartigan equipped himself with the armor of a knight from the castle's armory, and organized a singlehanded defence from Bavmorda's hordes, impressing Sorsha who abandoned her allegiance to her mother and fought by his side. Despite the arrival of reinforcements from the surviving knights of Galladoorn, the Nockmaar soldiers were able to steal away with Elora Danan.
Willow Ufgood brought the battle back to Nockmaar. While he, Sorsha and Fin Raziel infiltrated Bavmorda's tower, Madmartigan and Airk lead the knights in an attack on Nockmaar. With a clever ruse that hid their forces in covered trenches, they were able to make their way past the castle walls. Airk fell in battle, but Madmartigan took up his sword and defeated the Nockmaar commander, General Kael.
Willow and Fin Raziel were successful in destroying Bavmorda, and her reign of darkness came to an end. Raziel lifted the curse on Tir Asleen, and Madmartigan became a knight in service of the city as protector.

bateman,american psycho,362,Adult,Wall Street Investment Banker,Unknown,USA,Played by Christian Bale. Film adapted by a novel with the same name by Bret Easton Ellis. Set in New York in the late 80s. Stream of conscienceness narrative. ,I like to dissect girls. Did you know I'm utterly insane?,True,u327,m20,A man,"Bateman is the ultimate stereotype of yuppie (young urban professionals) greed: rich, shallow, and addicted to sex, drugs, and conspicuous consumption. All his friends look alike to him, to the point that he often confuses one for another, and they often confuse him for other people. Bateman takes delight in obsessively detailing virtually every single feature of his always designer clothes, workout routine, business cards, alcoholic drinks, as well as his elaborate high-end stereo and home theater sound system. He is engaged to an equally rich, shallow woman named Evelyn Richards. They can't stand each other, but they stay together for the sake of their social lives. He has a mistress on the side (the fiancee of a gay colleague whom he holds in great contempt and who makes repeated, hapless sexual advances towards Bateman) and has regular liaisons with prostitutes and women he encounters at clubs, many of whom end up being his victims. The one woman (and possibly the one person) in his life he has anything approaching feelings for is his secretary, Jean. He just cannot bring himself to seduce, rape or kill her, perhaps because she is the only person in his life who is not completely shallow. He casually acknowledges her as ""Jean, my secretary who is in love with me"" and introduces her in the narration as someone whom he ""will probably end up married to someday"".

Bateman often expresses doubts regarding his own sanity and he has periodic attacks of psychosis, during which he hallucinates. Bateman is therefore an unreliable narrator. He often experiences feelings of depersonalization. Bateman kills more or less indiscriminately, with no preferred type of victim and no consistent or preferred method of killing. Bateman kills many of his victims because they make him feel inadequate, usually by having better taste than he does. His friends mock him as the ""boy next door"", his own lawyer refers to him as a ""bloody ass-kisser... a brown-nosing goody-goody"", and he is often dismissed as ""yuppie trash"" by people outside his social circle.

Periodically, he matter-of-factly confesses his crimes to his friends, co-workers, and even complete strangers (""I like to dissect girls, did you know I'm utterly insane"") just to see if they are listening to him. They either are not, or they think that he is joking. In the movie's climactic scene, Bateman calls his lawyer and leaves a lengthy, detailed message confessing his crimes. He later runs into his lawyer, who mistakes him for someone else and dismisses the confession as a joke, also claiming to have had dinner with one of his victims after Bateman had supposedly killed him, leaving the supposed reality of Bateman's acts open to audience interpretation.

I had to care more about you than I do about me. I had to care more about what's right than I do about what's popular.,True,u4752,m316,A man,"Dave Kovic runs a temporary employment agency in Georgetown, Washington, D.C. and impersonates President Bill Mitchell as a side job. Secret Service agent Duane Stevenson recruits him to impersonate Mitchell after a speech, ostensibly as a security precaution, but in reality to cover up Mitchell’s affair with a staffer. Dave’s appearance goes well, but Mitchell suffers a major stroke while having sex, leading White House Chief of Staff Bob Alexander and Communications Director Alan Reed to ask Dave to continue in his role. Bob’s scheme is to force Vice President Gary Nance, a good man, to resign after purposefully embroiling him in a savings and loan scandal, and then have Dave, acting as Mitchell, appoint Bob as vice president, whereupon they will reveal Mitchell’s incapacity and Bob will become president. Alan is initially reluctant to agree to the plan, but eventually acquiesces and tells the press corps the stroke was minor. Dave agrees to keep impersonating Mitchell and Nance is sent on a good will tour of Africa.
Dave's charm and enthusiasm for life changes Mitchell’s previously grumpy image and increase his popularity. First Lady Ellen Mitchell, who has been privately estranged from her husband for years, is initially convinced that Dave is her husband and treats him with contempt on the few occasions they see each other. When Dave accompanies her to a homeless shelter, for which she is a staunch advocate, she sees his empathy towards a shy boy and begins to soften towards him. Her fury returns, though, after Bob forges Mitchell’s signature on the veto of a public works bill that included funding for the shelter. Dave, after consulting his accountant friend Murray Blum, works with the Cabinet to restore the funding. A furious Bob threatens to destroy Dave, but Alan vows to expose their scheme if he does. Ellen, having witnessed Dave's considerable efforts to save the shelter, confronts Dave and he admits he is an impostor. Dave has Duane escort them to the secret hospital room beneath the White House, where Mitchell remains in a coma. They both resolve to leave the White House, but become closer after spending a night out alone together. Ellen tells Dave she's gone along with the charade of being happily married to Bill because she thought she could help people as First Lady. Dave tells her he wishes he could do the same. They begin to fall in love and choose to stay.

The next day, Dave calls a press conference and, when Bob fires him, threatens to tell the press corps the truth about Mitchell. He orders Bob to resign and announces a plan to provide a job to every American who wants one. Nance returns from Africa and pleads his innocence of the scandal to Dave, who hears about Bob’s plot from Alan. To get back at Dave, Bob reveals evidence implicating Mitchell in the scandal, which Alan admits is true. Despite talk of impeachment, Dave refuses to back off his jobs plan. During a joint session of Congress, Dave admits that Bob’s allegations are true and takes responsibility for the scandal. He produces proof, furnished by Alan, that shows Bob was directly involved and Nance is innocent. As he continues his speech, he fakes another stroke and switches bodies with Mitchell on the way to the hospital, enabling him to resume his previous life. The hospital pronounces the ""second"" stroke as major and Mitchell continues to lie in a coma for several more months before dying. Nance becomes president, Bob and several administration officials are eventually indicted, and the jobs plan becomes law. Dave runs for city council with the help of Murray and his staff at his employment agency. Dave is surprised one day when Ellen visits. He escorts her into his office where they share their first kiss. Dave closes the shades to give them privacy and Duane steps in front of the door, wearing one of Dave’s campaign buttons.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_(film)
wade,affliction,256,Adult,Policeman,Unknown,USA,Played by Nick Nolte. Neo-Noir film based on the 1989 novel of the same name by Russell Banks.,I think there's some dirty business going on in this town.,True,u154,m10,A man,"Wade Whitehouse is a small-town policeman in New Hampshire. On Halloween night, Wade meets his daughter Jill, but he is late and the evening is overshadowed by disharmony. Jill eventually calls her mother, Wade's ex-wife, to come and pick her up. When his ex-wife finally arrives, Wade shoves her lover against their car and watches them drive away with Jill. Wade vows to get a lawyer to help gain custody of his daughter.
The next day, Wade rushes to the scene of a crime. Jack Hewitt, a local hunting guide, claims that Evan Twombley, with whom he was hunting, accidentally shot and killed himself. The police believe Jack, but Wade grows suspicious, believing that the man's death was no accident. When he is informed that the victim was scheduled to testify in a lawsuit, his suspicion slowly turns into conviction.
A while later, Wade and his girlfriend Margie Fogg arrive at the house of Wade's alcoholic father, Glen Whitehouse, whose abusive treatment of Wade and Rolfe as children is seen in flashbacks throughout the film. Wade finds his mother lying dead in her bed from hypothermia. Glen reacts to her death with little surprise, and later gets drunk at her wake and gets into a fight with Wade.
Rolfe, who has come home for the funeral, suggests at first that Wade's murder theory could be correct, but later renounces himself of this presumption. Nonetheless, Wade becomes obsessed with his conviction. When Wade learns that town Selectman Gordon Lariviere is buying up property all over town with the help from a wealthy land developer, he makes the solving of these incidents his personal mission. Suffering from a painful toothache and becoming increasingly socially detached, he behaves more and more unpredictably. He follows Jack, convinced that Jack is running away from something and is involved in a conspiracy. After a car chase, a nervous Jack finally pulls over, threatens Wade with a rifle, shoots out his tires, and drives off.
Finally, Wade is fired for harassing Jack and trashing Lariviere's office. He collects Jill from her mother's house, where his ex-wife furiously castigates him over his plans to sue for full custody. At a local restaurant, he attacks the bartender in front of his daughter. Then Wade takes Jill home to find Margie leaving him. Wade grabs Margie and begs her to stay, but Jill rushes up and tries to stop the fight. In response, Wade angrily pushes Jill, giving her a bloody nose forcing both her and Margie to drive off.
Wade is then approached by Glen, who congratulates him for finally acting as a ""real man"". The latent aggression between the men culminates in another fight in which Wade accidentally kills his father. He burns the corpse in the barn, sits down at the kitchen table and starts drinking.
Rolfe's narration reveals that Wade eventually murdered Jack and left town (possibly to Canada, where Jack's truck was found three days later), never to return. Rolfe relates that the town later became part of a huge ski resort partly organized by Gordon Lariviere, but having nothing to do with either Jack or Twombley. Rolfe concludes that someday a vagrant resembling Wade might be found frozen to death, and that will be the end of the story.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affliction_(1997_film)

Examining it, he saw fur sticking out from beneath the shell and realized that Walter took a dead cat and covered it in clay.

Leonard was ready to expose Walter until Paisley announced that he had just finished his next piece - ""Murdered Man"". Fearing what Paisley meant by the title, he reluctantly accompanied him back to his apartment where Walter unveiled the statue - a full-size likeness of a man with a gaping head wound. Carla felt the piece was wonderful, but Leonard began to suspect the truth; that the statue was in fact a dead body covered in clay. He could not bring himself to say anything however until he knew for sure though.

Walter continued to produce new, innovative pieces of art which included a sculpture of a nude woman and a severed human head. Leonard was disgusted at the display and now realized that not only was Walter using the remains of the dead in his artwork, but that he was actually murdering people to produce it. At a special exhibit at The Yellow Door, the truth was revealed. It was Carla who came to discover that the ""Alice"" statue consisted of the dead body of a local woman and former model. Walter fled from the café and many of the patrons chased after him. Leonard telephoned the police.",https://headhuntershorrorhouse.fandom.com/wiki/Leonard_de_Santis

alex,an american werewolf in london,136,Adult,Nurse,Unknown,England, ,I'm torn between feeling very sorry for you and finding you terribly attractive.,True,u269,m17,A woman,"Alex Price worked as a nurse at St. Martin's Hospital in London, England. She lived alone in a small flat and could barely make expenses from a nurse's income. In 1981, Alex was placed in charge of watching over a patient named David Kessler, who had been admitted after suffering severe lacerations across the face and chest from an alleged escaped lunatic. What Price didn't know at the time was that the so-called ""escaped lunatic"" was in fact a werewolf.

Price kept vigil over David for three weeks and eventually developed a close attraction to him. When David was discharged from the hospital, Alex knew that David had nowhere to go, so she invited him into her home. She embarrassingly admitted that she was not in the habit of inviting strange American men into her house, but she had grown incredibly fond of David, who eagerly reciprocated Alex's affections. That evening, Alex slept with David.

The following day, Alex went to work leaving David at the flat all alone. Near the end of her shift her superior, Doctor J.S. Hirsch, approached her and asked about David's werewolf fantasies. Aside from the trauma he suffered, Alex believed David was relatively stable. Hirsch was unconvinced and felt that David genuinely believed he was a werewolf. He recommended contacting the police.

Alex returned home, but David was not there. She didn't see him again until the following morning. David had a wild story to tell about waking up naked in a zoo, stealing a child's balloons and ultimately finding his way back home. Despite his odd behaviour, Kessler appeared to be in good spirits. When Doctor Hirsch discovered that David had returned, he asked Alex to bring him back to the hospital immediately.

En route to the hospital, Alex and David learned that six people were murdered the previous evening. David panicked, convinced that he truly was a werewolf and that he was responsible for the deaths of those people. He got out of the cab and ran into a nearby square where he begged a police officer to arrest him. Alex tried to keep him calm, but David was undeterred. Grabbing her, he professed that he loved her, but for her own protection, she needed to stay far away from him. Alex wanted David to come back with her to the hospital, but he refused. He ran off before she could say any more.

The next evening, Alex was working her shift at the hospital when Doctor Hirsch told her about a news broadcast reporting a ""wild animal"" sighting at Piccadilly Circus. Alex and he went to the cross-section where police had cordoned off an alleyway. Alex broke through the barricade and ran down the alley. To her horror, she found that everything David had told her was true. Standing before her was a giant werewolf. Alex instinctively knew that this was David and told him that she loved him. The werewolf seemed to understand her words but was gunned down by police only seconds later. The dead werewolf turned back into David Kessler before her eyes.

Frances becomes an actress and has some strong success in New York, but her refusal to bend her convictions and her outspoken (but sometimes naive) political expressiveness cause her difficulties, especially after she accepts a Hollywood contract. Torn between new-found success and intense feelings that she does not deserve the riches and fame she gains from the phoniness of Hollywood, Frances butts heads with studio executives and with her own mother, who revels in Frances's fame but provides Frances no emotional support. When drunken fights and arrests derail her career, Frances is sent to a psychiatric hospital with the acquiescence of her mother. What follows is a nightmare of poor treatment and psychological trauma, augmented by the increasing determination of Frances's mother to control her daughter's life. While institutionalized at Western State Hospital, Frances is abused by the powers that be: she is subjected to electroconvulsive shock therapy, is cruelly beaten, periodically raped by the male orderlies and visiting soldiers from a nearby military base and involuntarily lobotomized before her release in 1950.

By the end of the story, Tyler realized that he failed. The Narrator remained strongly opposed to Tyler's goals, and viewed Tyler's attempt to free him(self) as a hostile takeover of his mind. He never reached the full understanding that Tyler Durden was his real personality. The personality he percieved as ""himself"" was actually the fake, having been programmed into his head by society.",https://fightclub.fandom.com/wiki/Tyler_Durden

After walking through the moors of Yorkshire, England with his friend Jack Goodman, during the full moon they are stopped by a supernaturally large animal. The animal attacks both and kills Jack. The animal is then shot and killed by the pubgoers of the Slaughtered Lamb. The beast changes into the dying body of a naked man. David survives the mauling and is taken to a hospital in London.

When David wakes up three weeks later, he does not remember what happened and is told of his friend's death. Upon his release from the hospital, David moves in with Alex Price, the pretty young nurse who grew infatuated with him in the hospital. He stays in Alex's London apartment, where they later make love for the first time. Jack (in an advanced stage of decay) suddenly appears to David again and tells him that he will turn into a werewolf the next day.

The story focuses on the final months of James Whale and a fictional gardener named Clayton Boone. James Whale was a real person born 22nd July 1889, died 29th May 1957 (aged 67) and was an english film/theatre director and actor, who spent the greater part of his career in Hollywood. He is best remembered for several horror films: Frankenstein (1931), The Old Dark House (1932), The Invisible Man (1933) and Bride of Frankenstein (1935), all considered classics. Whale also directed films in other genres, including the 1936 film version of the musical Show Boat.","Making movies is the most wonderful thing in the world. Working with friends - entertaining people - yes, I suppose I miss it.",True,u5572,m370,A man,"In the 1950s, James Whale, the director of Frankenstein and Bride of Frankenstein, has retired. Whale lives with his long-time housemaid, Hanna, who loyally cares for him but disapproves of his homosexuality. He has suffered a series of strokes that have left him fragile and tormented by memories: growing up as a poor outcast, his tragic World War I service, and the filming of Bride of Frankenstein. Whale slips into his past and indulges in his fantasies, reminiscing about gay pool parties and sexually teasing an embarrassed, starstruck fan. He battles depression, and at times contemplates suicide, as he realizes his life, his attractiveness, and his health are slipping away. Whale befriends his young, handsome gardener, Clayton Boone, and the two begin a sometimes uneasy friendship as Boone poses for Whale's sketches. The two men bond while discussing their lives and dealing with Whale's spells of disorientation and weakness from the strokes. Boone, impressed with Whale's fame, watches Bride of Frankenstein on television as his friends mock the movie, his friendship with Whale, and Whale's intentions. Boone assures Whale that he is straight and receives Whale's assurance that there is no sexual interest, but Boone storms out when Whale graphically discusses his sexual history. Boone later returns with the agreement that no such ""locker room"" discussions occur again. Boone is invited to escort Whale to a party hosted by George Cukor for Princess Margaret. There, a photo op has been arranged for Whale with ""his Monsters"": Boris Karloff and Elsa Lanchester from ""ancient"" movie fame. This event exacerbates Whale's depression. A sudden rainstorm becomes an excuse to leave. Back at Whale's home, Clayton needs a dry change of clothes. Whale can only find a sweater, so Clayton wears a towel wrapped around his waist. Whale decides to try to sketch Clayton one more time. After some minutes, he shows his sketches to Clayton, disclosing that he has lost his ability to draw. After Clayton drops his towel to pose nude, Whale makes him wear a World War I gas mask and then uses the opportunity to make a sexual advance on Clayton, kissing his shoulder and neck, and forcefully reaches for his genitals. An enraged Clayton fights off Whale, who confesses that this had been his plan and begs Clayton to kill him to relieve him of his suffering. Clayton refuses, puts Whale to bed, then sleeps downstairs. The next morning, Hanna is alarmed when she cannot find Whale, prompting a search by Clayton and Hanna. Clayton finds Whale floating dead in the pool as a distraught Hanna runs out, clutching a suicide note. Clayton and Hanna agree that he should disappear from the scene to avoid a scandal.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gods_and_Monsters_(film)

Frank Pentangeli, head of the former Clemenza regime, now runs the family's business in New York. Michael's efforts at redeeming the family have been largely unsuccessful, however, because his many enemies and his growing obsession with revenge have kept him involved in the criminal underworld. Michael begins working out a deal with business partner and rival Hyman Roth over control of casino operations. However, Roth manipulates Michael's brother Fredo into providing him with information that he uses to arrange an attempt on Michael's life. Roth also attempts to murder Pentangeli while convincing the capo that Michael was to blame. Michael, Fredo and Roth travel to Cuba under Fulgencio Batista to forge a partnership with the Cuban government that will allow them to be free to conduct their operations in Cuba without interference from the authorities, in return for generous payments to Batista. While in Cuba, Michael sends his bodyguard to eliminate Roth on New Year's Eve, but the plan fails because the old man is hospitalized. That night, Michael discovers that Fredo had conspired with Roth. During the New Year's Eve festivities, Fidel Castro's rebel forces enter Havana, forcing Batista into exile and the crime bosses out of the country, their plans in Cuba ruined. Fredo, afraid of his brother, runs away into the crowd. Roth, meanwhile, flees to Miami. Back in the U.S., Michael meets with Fredo, who reveals that Roth's right-hand man, Johnny Ola, had promised to make him rich independently of the family if he informed on Michael, and that he withheld key information about the Senate investigation. Fredo also reveals that he has always resented his brother, and feels he should have taken over the family after their father's death. Michael disowns Fredo, and tells bodyguard Al Neri that nothing is to happen to his brother while their mother is alive; the implication is that, once she dies, Neri is to murder Fredo. Meanwhile, Pentangeli has been persuaded to testify against Michael in the Senate's investigation of organized crime. However, Michael arranges for Pentageli's brother Vincenzo to travel from Sicily to attend the hearings. Seeing his brother in the hearing room and understanding the threat, Pentageli renounces his earlier sworn statements, throwing the hearings into chaos and effectively ending the government's case against Michael. Meanwhile, Kay realizes that Michael will always live in a world of crime and violence, and decides to leave him and take the children with her. Michael begs her to reconsider, but an un-mollified Kay reveals that what she had initially told Michael was a miscarriage was in fact an abortion; she tells Michael that she doesn't want to bring another of his children into the world. Enraged, Michael hits Kay in the face and banishes her from the family; they divorce later that year, with Michael keeping custody of the children. He would later give up custody of the children to Kay after realizing it would be best for them. Following the death of their mother, and at the behest of his sister Connie, Michael appears to reconcile with his brother. It is only a ploy to draw him in, however; soon afterward, Neri murders Fredo on Michael's orders.

You didn't.",True,u16,m1,A man,"Aware that the world is round, Columbus lobbies for a trip to Asia but lacks a crew and ship. Catholic theologians at University of Salamaca heavily disproves of his plan. Columbus is approached by Martín Pinzón, a shipowner from Palos, who introduces him to the banker Santángel, to whom Queen Isabella I owes money. Columbus meets with the queen, who grants him his journey in exchange for his promise to bring back sufficient amounts of riches in gold. Columbus deceives many crewmen by telling them that the voyage will only last seven weeks. Three ships depart. Nine weeks go by with no sign of land. The crew becomes restless and edges toward mutiny. He tries to reinvigorate them with an inspiring speech, coinciding with a fast wind, which goads the men to return to their duties. At night, Columbus notices mosquitoes on the deck, indicating that land is not far off. Suddenly, out of the mist they see the lush vegetation and sandy beaches of Guanahani. The Europeans befriend the local natives, who show them gold they have collected. Columbus teaches one of them Spanish so that they can communicate. He then informs them that he will return to Spain, which will be followed by the arrival of many more Europeans. Columbus leaves behind a group to begin the colonisation of the Americas. In Spain, he receives a high honour from the queen and has dinner with the council. They express disappointment with the small amount of gold he brought back, but the queen approves of his gifts. On the second expedition, Columbus takes 17 ships and over 1,000 men with him to the island; however, all the crewmen left behind are found to have been killed. When the tribe is confronted by Columbus and his troops, they tell him that another tribe came and killed them. Columbus chooses to believe them, but his commanding officer Moxica is not convinced. They begin to build the city of La Isabela and eventually manage to hoist the town bell into its tower. Four years later, the natives are being forced to mine for gold. Moxica punishes one who fails to find any gold by cutting off his hand. The word of this act of violence spreads throughout the native tribes and they all disappear into the forest. Columbus begins to worry about a potential war, with the natives heavily outnumbering them. Upon return to his home, he finds his house set ablaze by Moxica and his followers, confirming his unpopularity among factions of the settlers. Soon, the tribes arrive to fight the Spaniards and the island becomes war-torn, with Columbus' governorship being reassigned with orders for him to return to Spain. Columbus is accused of nepotism,and injuring the pride of the nobles such as Moxica; he is replaced by de Bobadilla. Columbus returns to Castile to be imprisoned, but is bailed out by his sons. When he is summoned by the queen, she is reluctantly convinced to allow him to make another voyage, with the proviso that he neither take his brothers nor return to the colonies. As an old man, Columbus is virtually forgotten in Spain, with the discovery of the New World being credited to Amerigo Vespucci. Columbus's son Ferdinand asks his father to tell him his story so he can transcribe it.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1492:_Conquest_of_Paradise

After his mother's suicide while he was a child, he moved to the Philippines to live with his father, Byron, a US Navy Boatswain's Mate First Class, a drunk, and a womanizer. Zack grows up as a Navy brat at U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay and is now determined—despite his father's disapproval—to become a Navy pilot. When he signs up for the Aviation Academy, he is met with the strict leadership of Sgt. Emil Foley, who gives Zack a rude awakening in terms of relating with other people. Zack and fellow candidate Sid Worley meet two local factory workers, Paula Pokrifki and Lynette Pomeroy, at a Navy Ball. Zack begins a relationship with Paula, while Sid dates Lynette.
Foley runs the program mercilessly, Foley believes Zack lacks motivation and is not a team player, and when he discovers Zack has been selling pre-shined shoes and belt buckles, he punishes Zack with an entire weekend of hazing to make him quit the program. Zack refuses, and Foley tells him he will expel him. Upon hearing this, Zack breaks down and admits that he has no options in civilian life. Satisfied that Zack has come to a crucial self-realization, Foley relents. 
During his last obstacle-course run, Zack has a chance to break the course record, but instead stops to encourage his teammate, Casey Seeger, to succeed. Zack attends a dinner with Sid and his parents and learns that Sid has a long-time girlfriend who was his late brother's girlfriend, and whom he is planning to marry once he receives his commission. 
After having a severe anxiety attack during a high-altitude simulation in a pressure chamber, Sid quits. He goes to Lynette's house to propose marriage but she rejects him, telling him she wants to marry a naval aviator, and that she got her period and so is not pregnant. After Sid leaves, Zack shows up with Paula looking for Sid; after Lynette recaps the conversation with Sid, Zack accuses her of making up the pregnancy, which she denies. Zack and Paula go looking for Sid and discover that he has hanged himself. Zack blames himself and heads back to base, intending to quit, but Foley will not let him. They fight, with Zack landing several blows on a surprised Foley before the latter ends the fight and tells Zack he can quit if he wants.
Zack completes the training and is commissioned as an officer; following tradition, he receives his first salute from Foley in exchange for a US silver dollar. Zack thanks Foley for not giving up on him and says he would have never made it without him. Zack finds Paula at the factory and declares his love to her, then picks her up and walks out with her in his arms to the applause of all her colleagues, including Lynette.

Neil is upset that a new intern is starting at the hospital -- A Nightmare on Elm Street survivor Nancy Thompson—dismissing her as a hotshot grad student trying to make her name off of the children. However, when newly admitted patient Kristen Parker panics and attacks interns that try to sedate her, Nancy appears and connects immediately with Kristen. He realizes that Nancy is not quite what she seems, having considerable knowledge in the nightmares that has been haunting his kids, and being on the dream suppressant drug Hypnocil. When Nancy suggests to Neil to put the children on Hypnocil, he refuses. However, after the death of Phillip Anderson, the other psychiatrist on duty, Elizabeth Simms incorporates a schedule of sedating the children each night. This causes panic among the children, causing Neil to prescribe Hypnocil lest he resign from the job. At a funeral for one of the children, Neil meets up with a nun who asks him about his faith. He gives it to her as science, which she tells him will likely end with his death. Needing to know how to help the children, he listens to Nancy as she tells him about Freddy Krueger, a killed serial killer who appears in the dreams of the children of the adults who killed him. Neil agrees to have a hypnosis session with the group and enters the Dream World with them. However, Simms interrupts the session, bringing every child except for Joey Crusel out of the Dream World.

Because it insults my intelligence and makes me very angry.,True,u3105,m203,A man,"Michael Corleone is a young man in his mid-20s. He initially wants nothing to do with the family business. Michael enrolled at Dartmouth College in order to escape the Corleone legacy. After the United States enters World War II in 1941, Michael drops out to enlist in the Marine Corps and fights in the Pacific, despite his father's misgivings. Michael is wounded in battle, but is awarded the Navy Cross for bravery and is featured in Life magazine in 1944. Michael is discharged as a captain in early 1945 to recover from his wounds. He re-enters Dartmouth, where he meets his future wife, Kay Adams, and has dreams of leading a more normal life away from his family. However, when his father is nearly assassinated in late 1945, he is thrust back into the world he has avoided for so long. Reaffirming his loyalty at his father's bedside, Michael volunteers to kill both the men responsible: the drug kingpin Virgil Sollozzo and corrupt police captain Mark McCluskey. He meets with Sollozzo and McCluskey at a restaurant, where he kills both. Following the murders, Michael flees to Sicily, where he lives for two years under the watch of family friend Don Tommasino. While there, he falls in love with and marries a beautiful young woman named Apollonia. However, she is killed by a car bomb intended for Michael, planted by a corrupt bodyguard. While in Sicily, Michael learns that his older brother Sonny, who took over as acting head of the family after Vito was wounded, has been murdered. Michael returns to New York around 1950 and becomes fully involved in the family's criminal enterprises, taking over Sonny's role as Vito's heir apparent. A year later, he rekindles his relationship with Kay and marries her, promising her that the Corleone family would be legitimate within five years. Michael tries to buy out casino owner Moe Greene's stake in the casino, intending to move the family to Nevada, but Greene refuses. After his father goes into semi-retirement in 1954, Michael becomes operating head of the family, officially becoming Don after his father's death in 1955. Before his death, Vito warns Michael that the head of a rival family would make an attempt on Michael's life under the pretense of organizing a peace summit between the two families. At the funeral, Vito's caporegime Salvatore Tessio inadvertently reveals that he had conspired with rival Don Emilio Barzini against him. Michael arranges the murders of the leaders of the New York Mafia's other ruling families Dons: Barzini, Philip Tattaglia, Carmine Cuneo, and Victor Stracci, as well as Moe Greene. During the baptism of his sister Connie's child, these men were all killed by Corleone associates. Tessio and Carlo Rizzi, Connie's abusive husband, who had earlier set Sonny up to be murdered, are eliminated a short time later. In one stroke, Michael re-establishes the Corleone family as the most powerful crime family in the nation, and makes a reputation for himself as being even more cunning and ruthless than his father. When Connie finds out that Michael had Carlo killed, she flies into a rage. When Kay asks him about it, Michael denies any involvement in the murder. Moments later, however, Michael meets with his capos, where Peter Clemenza greets him as ""Don Corleone"" and kisses his hand much as he did with his father. Kay realizes that Connie was telling the truth, and that her husband has become the new Don Corleone.",https://villains.fandom.com/wiki/Michael_Corleone

Soon later, Elora Danan was rescued from the River Freen by his children. The village was afterwards raided by Death Dogs. The villagers were angry for the one who caused the disaster. Willow wanted to keep the baby secret, but with advice from the High Aldwin it was decided that he should take the child to the Daikini crossroads and be given to a Daikini human. Meegosh and a small company accompanied Willow to the crossroads but they would return to the village without Willow.

The trek was lengthy, until they met a captive swordsman, Madmartigan, to whom he eventually gave the baby too after days of no other Daikini’s offering help or willingness to listen, only to find it a short while later captured by mischievous Brownies. They led Willow to Cherlindrea of the Forest, who explained the child's fate, the future empress of Tir Asleen and vanquisher of the evil Queen Bavmorda whose forces were conquering all lands. The fairy tasked Willow to take Elora to the sorceress Fin Raziel, held captive on an isolated island. She would lead them to Tir Asleen, where a great army awaited to repulse Bavmorda's forces. Willow separates from his friend Meegosh and continues his quest with Elora and the two brownies as guides.

Willow soon crossed roads again with Madmartigan, who joined him in his quest. Eventually they found Fin Raziel shifted in animal form by a spell, and Willow failed to dispel. Upon finding Tir Asleen, they discovered that it was cursed, and no army waited to repulse Bavmorda's forces. Tir Asleen was invaded and Bavmorda’s forces absconded with the baby.

The survivors of Galladoorn, recently decimated by Kael's army, arrived in time to join the team. They took the fight to Bavmorda's castle keep at Nockmaar. As the battle raged Willow restored Raziel to her true form with magic and together entered Bavmorda's citadel. The two sorceresses engaged in a magic battle while Willow rescued baby Elora Danan from the sacrificial altar. Using a simple trick, Willow made it seem as if he had teleported Elora to safety. Bavmorda lost control of her roiling spells and was consumed by her dark powers.

With Bavmorda eliminated, the dark pall she cast over the world vanished. Raziel restored Tir Asleen, and Elora Danan was delivered to foster parents. Raziel gave Willow her book of magic, and Willow returned to the Nelwyn Village.

One day, shortly before Christmas, a fly becomes jammed in a teleprinter, which misprints a copy of an arrest warrant it was receiving.

The workers later return to demolish Sam's ducts and seize his apartment under the pretence of fixing the system.

The two share a romantic night together, but in the morning are apprehended by the government at gunpoint. Sam is told that Jill was killed while resisting arrest. Charged with treason for abusing his new position, Sam is restrained in a chair in a large, empty cylindrical room, to be tortured by his old friend, Jack Lint.
Sam descends into irrecoverable insanity, Jack and Mr Helpmann declare him a lost cause and leave the room. Sam remains in the chair, smiling and humming ""Aquarela do Brasil"" to himself.

She notices when he loses his composure after one of the barflies, Angelo, makes fun of him, believing he works for toons. She is quick to garner the barflies' sympathy for him once she reveals the truth behind his hatred of toons to them, explaining that his brother, Teddy, was killed by one by having a piano dropped on his head. She apparently cares for him and even helps him when the latter explains about Judge Doom and the Toon Patrol, who are all after Roger Rabbit because he supposedly murdered Marvin Acme. She also seems to know about his will, as she warns Eddie of how Cloverleaf Industries had placed the highest bid for Toontown and will acquire it at midnight if Acme's will fails to show up by then when Toontown will be put up on the auction block. She plays a larger part in the film's climax, where she saves Eddie from almost being killed by Judge Doom and the Toon Patrol when they come for Roger at the bar by providing a drink that causes him to erupt like a high-pitched steam whistle so Eddie could fight off the Toon Patrol and rescue him. She armed herself with a bat in case things escalate further. For her part in the bar fight, she presumably got fired as a result. Following the climactic battle at the Acme Factory that saw Judge Doom's death, she arrives with Benny the Cab, Lt. Santino, and the LAPD, where Eddie proves Roger was innocent of murdering Acme, while Doom was guilty of murdering him, R.K. Maroon, and Teddy, along with the attempted murder of everyone in Toontown. She is last seen walking beside Eddie as they, along with Roger and Jessica, enter Toontown together while accompanied by all the other toons in the film singing ""Smile Darn Ya Smile"".",https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Dolores

laurie,watchmen,93,Adult,Vigilante,Unknown,USA, ,The most powerful thing in the universe... still just a puppet.,True,u8985,m612,A woman,"Laurel Jane ""Laurie"" Juspeczyk was born on December 1, 1949 and was raised by her mother, Sally Jupiter, and her husband, Laurence Schexnayder; after her birth, problems in the couple's marriage began. Laurie's first memory ever was a night of 1954 when she caught her mother and Laurence, arguing and fighting over their lives and how they ended up together. In reality, Laurence scolded Sally for having another affair with the Comedian. Growing up, the auburn-haired Laurie knew Laurence was not her real father, and always suspected, incorrectly, that her real father was Hooded Justice likely because they were, supposedly, dating during the 1940s. Since when she was little, Laurie wanted to work with animals, however, Sally pushed her into the ""family business"" of costumed crimefighting. She had bought her GI Joe with spare uniforms. Laurie never held much interest in becoming her mother's successor but went along with Sally's wishes anyway. She spent much of her childhood by working out in the gym, alone. By 1962 Laurie was living with her mother in a Los Angeles villa where Sally's former Minutemen teammates such as Nelson Gardner, Byron Lewis, and Hollis Mason would pay them a visit, like when the Mason came to discuss the book he was writing. This ignited Sally's motivations for Laurie's future. In 1966, she acted like an agent for her daughter, picking out her revealing costume.Laurie Juspeczyk is liberal-thinking and said to be a ""modern"" woman. Laurie may be proud of her Polish heritage, which could account partly for her insistence to be called by her real last name, but she was not inclined towards crimefighting initially and she seems to have bitterness for the 'Miss Jupiter' christening. She is vocal in her feminist and humanitarian concerns and is quite a conditioned fighter, and at the start of the story is shown to have a strained relationship with her mother, another reason for her to not like the Jupiter name. Driven by the memories of her own experience, Sally tried to keep Laurie from knowing some of the harsher realities of the crime-fighting life; for example, she didn't allow her to read Hollis Mason's autobiography Under the Hood, which included The Comedian's sexual assault on Sally, something Laurie knew nothing of at the time. Just like many characters in Watchmen, Laurie is portrayed as having superhuman physical abilities, as she could break bone effortlessly with one strike and send people flying or cause them to flip into the air. She was unfazed by the strength of her opponents and could overpower them with little to no effort. Nite Owl II and the Comedian seemed to match her in strength and fighting abilities, but all of them were surpassed by Adrian Veldt. She also could jump from several feet and perform a combat roll without any harm or weakness. Juspeczyk is a master martial artist. She has trained ever since she was five years old by her mother and several other teachers. She is able to hold her own against several muggers and other foes without being injured. Juspeczyk is also an incredible gymnast after training all her life. From practicing gymnastics, Laurie has excellent balance. She can perform flips and kicks while wearing high heels. As a Master Marksman, Juspeczyk can use firearms, as she shot a bullet at Adrian, which would have hit his chest had he not moved his hand in the bullet's path and had it lodged into his palm.",https://watchmen.fandom.com/wiki/Laurie_Juspeczyk

Gets 'em every time.,True,u7295,m492,A man,"Initially, Eddie has a hard-boiled disposition, coming across as stubborn and cynical from the start of the film. He initially harbours a general distaste for Toons since his brother Teddy died in 1942; when he and Teddy were chasing the unknown Toon form of Judge Doom, who was robbing the First National Bank of Toontown (the home of all the Toons), during the chase, Doom dropped a large piano on them from 15 stories up. Eddie survived with a broken arm, but Teddy was killed. Since his death, Eddie stopped taking cases for Toons and began to drink heavily, and disappeared from the public eye, and becoming the subject of ridicule among the police force and is still haunted by the last image he of his brother’s killer having burning red eyes; a high squeaky voice, and the unforgiving sound of a piano smashing to pieces. Despite this, he retains his street smarts, as well as his knowledge of Toon rules and culture. Prior to Teddy's death, both brothers were sons of a Barnum and Bailey circus clown (shown by the pictures on their desk in the film), who joined the police force; they graduated from the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) in 1925. They eventually started their own private investigation service, Valiant & Valiant, in 1934, working largely on Toon cases such as the kidnapping of Donald Duck's nephews in 1937, and clearing Goofy of accusations of espionage in 1940 with possibly being a spy for the Axis Powers, such as the Nazis, during World War II. They were known to be extremely fun-loving and would do anything for a laugh. They were the only known humans who could ever out-funny a Toon. Underneath his gruff exterior, Eddie proves to be a loyal comrade (aiding Roger in his time of need, despite his own reservations), and has a soft spot for his girlfriend Dolores. Despite his distaste for Toons following his brother's death, he is not completely apathetic, hateful or hostile towards them, as he was shown to be shocked disbelief and horrified over Judge Doom murdering the innocent Toon Shoe with ‘The Dip’ right in front of his eyes and his later camaraderie with Betty Boop in the Ink and Paint Club. By the film's end, he gives up drinking; is finally at peace with Teddy's death when he defeats the evil Judge Doom, Teddy's murderer, and has reconciled with the Toons.",https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Eddie_Valiant

Kirill meets up with Yuri Gretcov, an oil magnate to whom he gives him the files & proceeds to go to India & kill Bourne. Bourne, however determines Kirill to be a threat (while mistaking him for a Treadstone operative) & tries to flee with Marie. Kirill goes after them & gets a clear shot of the back of the car. However, due to not seeing the seat change between Bourne & Marie, he kills her by mistake & thinks Bourne is dead. Bourne shortly manages to escape undetected, takes his belongings with several passports & money & makes his way to Naples, Italy. Bourne is forced to resume his former life as a trained assassin to survive. ourne makes his way to Berlin where he follows Landy into a CIA safehouse & arranges a meeting Landy & Nicky Parsons via phone at Alexanderplatz. He avoids detection from Landy & her team, then captures Nicky & interrogates her. He learns from her that Abbott, not Conklin, was the head of Treadstone, and also remembers his first mission in Berlin, which Nicky knows nothing about. While hearing Bourne's conversation via Nicky's transmitter, Landy begins to suspect Bourne is being framed & to the surprise of both Abbott & Landy, Bourne lets Nicky go unharmed & heads to the Becker hotel where the Neskis were killed. Abbott kills Danny Zorn when the latter also suspects Bourne's innocence, thus proving his involvement in a conspiracy. Bourne arrives at the hotel inadvertently attracting the attention of the Berlin police aswell as Pamela Landy and recalls more of his mission: Bourne was sent to Berlin to kill Neski on Conklin's orders, but was forced to kill her wife as well when she unexpectedly came to the room, thus made it look like a murder-suicide.

Had Bourne died, the CIA would've been gone on a wild goose chase and Abbott & Gretcov would've covered their tracks indefinitely. Landy arrives at Abbott's hotel room after Bourne leaves & also confronts him with Abbott not regretting his actions. He then commits suicide in front of Landy using Bourne's handgun. Bourne arrives in Moscow alerting the Russian police & Kirill, and after being wounded in the shoulder engages them in a high speed chase through the streets. The chase ends when Bourne rams his stolen taxi on to Kirill's vehicle inside a tunnel & seeing him critically injured, walks away.

He was declared mentally incompetent in a lawsuit following a test flight that Ted piloted and in which the lunar shuttle crashed. Ted believes the lawsuit was meant to silence him regarding dangerous safety issues related to the lunar shuttle. He is again haunted by his actions in ""The War"" – specifically the loss of his entire squadron above ""Macho Grande"" – resulting in a relapse of his ""drinking problem"". When Ted learns of the lunar shuttle's upcoming launch, he escapes the asylum and buys a ticket for the flight. During the flight, Mayflower One suffers a short circuit, causing the artificially intelligent computer, ROK, to go insane and send the ship toward the Sun. Unger and Dunn try to deactivate the computer, but are blown out of an airlock. Oveur tries to stop ROK, but the computer gasses him. Simon abandons Elaine and leaves in the sole escape pod. Once again, Ted is called upon to save the day, but he must first figure out how to wrest control of the shuttle from the computer. Air traffic controller Steve McCroskey reveals that passenger Joe Seluchi had boarded with a bomb in a briefcase, intent on committing suicide to provide an insurance payout for his wife. Ted manages to wrestle the bomb from Joe, uses it to blow up ROK, and sets course for the Moon as originally intended. The computer's destruction results in collateral damage to the shuttle; the flight is not yet out of danger. En route to the Moon, flight control shifts to a lunar base under the command of Commander Buck Murdock. Contemptuous of Ted because of Macho Grande, he nonetheless agrees to help and they manage to land the craft safely on the Moon. Ted and Elaine fall back in love and are married at the end.

There, a photo op has been arranged for Whale with ""his Monsters"": Boris Karloff and Elsa Lanchester from ""ancient"" movie fame. This event exacerbates Whale's depression. A sudden rainstorm becomes an excuse to leave. Back at Whale's home, Clayton needs a dry change of clothes. Whale can only find a sweater, so Clayton wears a towel wrapped around his waist. Whale decides to try to sketch Clayton one more time. After some minutes, he shows his sketches to Clayton, disclosing that he has lost his ability to draw. After Clayton drops his towel to pose nude, Whale makes him wear a World War I gas mask and then uses the opportunity to make a sexual advance on Clayton, kissing his shoulder and neck, and forcefully reaches for his genitals. An enraged Clayton fights off Whale, who confesses that this had been his plan and begs Clayton to kill him to relieve him of his suffering. Clayton refuses, puts Whale to bed, then sleeps downstairs. The next morning, Hanna is alarmed when she cannot find Whale, prompting a search by Clayton and Hanna. Clayton finds Whale floating dead in the pool as a distraught Hanna runs out, clutching a suicide note. Clayton and Hanna agree that he should disappear from the scene to avoid a scandal. A decade later, Clayton and his son, Michael, watch Bride of Frankenstein on television. Michael is skeptical of his father's claim that he knew Whale, but Clayton produces a sketch of the Frankenstein monster drawn by Whale, and signed, ""To Clayton. Friend?"" ""Friend?"" being a plea from the original misfit, Frankenstein's monster, and disclosing Whale's true intentions. Clayton later walks down a street at night in the rain, miming the movements of Frankenstein's monster.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gods_and_Monsters_(film)
